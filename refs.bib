		  Higgs field is asymptotic to a standard holomorphic

		  asserting the existence of time-periodic solutions of the
		  Abelian Higgs model on {\$} {\{}{\backslash}Bbb R{\}}
		  {\backslash}times S^2 {\$} which represent two vortices in

		  whether a balance between the inter-vortex attraction and
		  the centrifugal repulsion provides for the existence of
		  such solutions (as it does in the classical two body
		  problem for point particles.) The starting point of the
		  analysis is the adiabatic limit system, i.e. the
		  Hamiltonian system defined by restricting the Abelian Higgs
		  model to the moduli space of self-dual vortices. The
		  Hamiltonian consists of a potential energy term and kinetic
		  energy term which is given by the metric on the moduli
		  space induced from {\$} L^2 {\$} . It is shown under two
		  assumptions on the metric and potential energy that the
		  adiabatic limit system admits periodic solutions of the
		  required type. Periodic solutions to the full system are
		  then obtained by an application of the implicit function
		  theorem. Explicit examples where the assumptions on the
		  adiabatic limit system hold are provided by the
		  computations of the metric and potential in the Bradlow

		  model proposed by B.J. Schroers in which the matter field
		  {\o} mapsR2 intoS2 while the vector gauge potential gives
		  rise to a magnetic field. It is shown that for each natural
		  numberN there are solutions to saturate the classical
		  energy lower boundE‚âß4$\pi$N for the field configurations
		  in the topological family deg({\o})=N if and only ifN‚â†1.
		  Furthermore the solutions obtained depend on at least
		  4N‚àí3 continuous parameters, the associated magnetic flux
		  can assume its value in an open interval, and the decay
		  rates of the field strengths may be specified in a suitable
		  range. These solutions are multisolitons represented byN
		  prescribed lumps of the magnetic field, simulatingN
		  identical particles in equilibrium, and are governed by a
		  nonlinear elliptic equation with both vortex and
		  anti-vortex source terms.",
